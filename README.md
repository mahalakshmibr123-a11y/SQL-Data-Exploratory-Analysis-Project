# SQL Data Exploratory Analysis Project

A curated collection of SQL scripts demonstrating a wide range of analytical techniques used in real-world data analysis, reporting, and business intelligence.

## 📂 Contents

### **1. Changes Over Time**

Scripts that analyze how metrics evolve across days, weeks, months, or years.

* Month-over-month (MoM) growth
* Year-over-year (YoY) comparison
* Rolling window comparisons (7-day, 30-day, etc.)
* Period-over-period change using window functions

---

### **2. Cumulative Analysis**

Scripts showing cumulative and running calculations.

* Running totals using `SUM() OVER`
* Running averages and moving averages
* Cumulative percentage progress
* Time-series accumulation

---

### **3. Performance Analysis**

Measure performance across multiple dimensions.

* Sales performance by product, region, or category
* Rank-based performance using `RANK()`, `DENSE_RANK()`, `ROW_NUMBER()`
* KPI comparisons and benchmark analysis
* Top-N and Bottom-N evaluations

---

### **4. Data Segmentation**

SQL scripts focusing on slicing data into logical segments.

* Customer segmentation (RFM model)
* Behavioral segmentation (active, dormant, new users)
* Revenue segmentation (high, medium, low)
* Temporal segmentation (first-time vs repeat customers)

---

### **5. Part-to-Whole Analysis**

Understand how individual elements contribute to the overall dataset.

* Contribution percentage using windowed aggregations
* Pareto (80/20) analysis
* Market share analysis
* Category-wise distribution

---

## 🛠 Techniques Used

This repository includes SQL patterns using:

* Window functions (`OVER`, partitioning, ordering)
* Subqueries and common table expressions (CTEs)
* Aggregations and grouping
* Conditional logic with `CASE`
* Joins and set-based operations
